# Summary
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm along with k means algorithm we are able to visualize data and determine the most tradable cryptocurrencies.We were able to find 532 tradable cryptocurrencies which could be a a good potential addition to the investment portfolio. Along with the help of the unsupervised machine learning algorithms we were able to conclude our findings.
