# Cryptocurrencies

  Present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing a new investment product. Use unsupervised ML clustering algorithm to help determine cryptocurrencies groups.

# Summary
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, along with k means algorithm, we are able to visualize data and determine the most tradable cryptocurrencies. Based on elbow curve figure, I decided to group preprocessed 533 cryptocurrencies into 4 clusters in oder to find their patterns. The 2d scatter figure shows clusters related to the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins. The 3d scatter graph clearly displays different clusters distributed with 3 principal component variables. Along with the help of the unsupervised machine learning algorithms we were able to conclude our findings.
